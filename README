This repository contains five services that return XML data in response to an http request. There is also detailed documentation in the Word file.

The first four services are independent elements that get a piece of the picture. 

The last service, getbibsetxml.cgi, does everything for a given bib id - it returns an XML set consisting of:

	bibliographic data 
	item(s) link to the bib record
	the item(s) status 
	the item(s) temporary location. 

The last service has all of the values we currently use in Surveyor to determine an item's consortium loan eligibility: 

	library 
	permanent location description 
	temporary location description 
	item status description
